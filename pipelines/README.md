# Autocycler pipelines and setup scripts

This directory contains pipelines, scripts and environment setups to help run Autocycler end-to-end or install its dependencies. Some were contributed by users, others are mine, and I'm happy to include them all.

Because there's no single best approach (e.g. Conda, Docker, Bash, Snakemake, Nextflow, etc), and I can't personally maintain every method, these resources are provided as-is. They may serve as useful starting points but could be outdated or incompatible with your system.



## Usage

Feel free to use one of these resources as-is, modify it for your needs or write your own from scratch. If you build something that might help others, you're welcome to contribute it to this directory by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/rrwick/Autocycler/pulls).



## Contributing

If you'd like to add a pipeline or setup, please follow these basic submission guidelines:

* Place your contribution in its own directory. Include all required files within this directory.
* Provide documentation: either a `README.md` in the subdirectory or inline comments in your scripts.
* State which Autocycler version you used, as this can help others assess compatibility if and when Autocycler changes in future.
* Add a license (a file or comment block) to clarify reuse terms.
* If you update your contribution in the future, feel free to submit another pull request to keep it current.
